# üõ°Ô∏è Week 5 Lab Summary ‚Äî Hosts File Spoofing & DNS Lookup

This lab focused on understanding how domain name resolution works through DNS and the `/etc/hosts` file. We practiced looking up IP addresses, editing the hosts file, spoofing domains, and observing the effects using Firefox.

---

## ‚úÖ Step 0: Check IP Addresses for Two Different Websites

- Opened Ubuntu VM in VirtualBox.
- Opened the terminal using:  
  `Applications ‚Üí Terminal Emulator`
- Ran the following commands:
  ```bash
  dig eu.httpbin.org +nocomments
  dig neverssl.com +nocomments
  ```
- Recorded the IP addresses returned for each domain:
  - `eu.httpbin.org` ‚Üí `<your IP here>`
  - `neverssl.com` ‚Üí `<your IP here>`

## ‚úÖ Step 1: Install Firefox Browser

- Checked if Firefox was installed:
  ```bash
  firefox -v
  ```
- If not found, installed it using:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get -y install firefox
  ```
- Verified the browser appears under:  
  `Applications ‚Üí Internet ‚Üí Firefox Web Browser`

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 1 Complete**

## ‚úÖ Step 2: Navigate to the `/etc` Hosts File

Practiced basic Linux commands:

```bash
cd ~        # Go to home directory
pwd         # Print current directory
cd ..       # Move up one level
cd etc      # Go into /etc directory
ls          # List contents
```

- Located the `hosts` file in `/etc`.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 2 Complete**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 3: Examine the Hosts File

- Opened the file in view mode:
  ```bash
  nano hosts
  ```
- Observed default entries like:
  ```
  127.0.0.1   localhost
  ::1         localhost
  ```
- Noted the file was unwritable in this mode.
- Exited using `Ctrl + X`.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 3 Complete**

## ‚úÖ Step 4: View Web Pages in the Browser

- Opened Firefox browser.
- Visited both:
  - http://eu.httpbin.org
  - http://www.neverssl.com
- Observed their original page content.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 4 Complete**

## ‚úÖ Step 5: Clear Firefox Browser History

To avoid cached responses affecting results:

1. Opened `History ‚Üí Manage History ‚Üí Delete Pages`
2. Opened `Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security`
3. Enabled:
   - "Delete cookies and site data when Firefox is closed"
4. Cleared cookies, site data, and browsing history:
   - Disabled "Remember browsing and download history"
   - Disabled "Remember search and form history"

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 5 Complete**

## ‚úÖ Step 6: Edit the Hosts File to Spoof IPs

- Reopened hosts file with write access:
  ```bash
  sudo nano hosts
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3206b14-70ca-47b0-aa57-9352b8950c29)

  ```
- Added spoofing entries:
  ```
  <IP of eu.httpbin.org>     www.neverssl.com
  <IP of neverssl.com>       eu.httpbin.org
  ```
- Saved using `Ctrl + O` ‚Üí Enter  
  Exited using `Ctrl + X`

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 6 Complete**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 7: Confirm Spoofed DNS with `dig`

- Ran:
  ```bash
  dig eu.httpbin.org +nocomments
  dig www.neverssl.com +nocomments
  ```
- Verified that the IP addresses were now **swapped**.

‚úÖ **Checkpoint 7 Complete**

---

## ‚úÖ Step 8: Check Web Pages Again in Firefox

- Revisited:
  - http://eu.httpbin.org
  - http://www.neverssl.com
- Confirmed that:
  - `httpbin.org` now loads neverssl content
  - `neverssl.com` now loads httpbin content

‚úÖ Spoofing verified visually

---

## ‚úÖ Step 9: Restore the Hosts File

- Opened the hosts file:
  ```bash
  sudo nano hosts
  ```
- Removed the spoofing entries.
- Saved and exited.
- Restored Firefox settings (optional):
  - Re-enabled default history/cookie settings

‚úÖ Lab cleanup complete.

## üß† Reflection: What I Learned

- How to use `dig` to perform DNS lookups
- The purpose and function of the `/etc/hosts` file
- How local spoofing overrides DNS responses
- How browser cache/history can impact DNS testing
