## üîê Cryptography Challenges

### Challenge 7: Shifty (2 points)
**Encrypted Message:** `Qeb mxpptloa fp MibxpbZexkdbJb`  
**Answer:** The encryption used is ROT13
**Decrypted Text:** `The password is PleaseChangeMe`  
**Steps Taken:**
- Opened CyberChef and used the ROT13 tool
Noticed the shift wasn't ROT13, so tried different amounts
Found the correct output at a ROT shift of 29
Output made logical sense and revealed a full sentence

### Challenge 9: Kasiski Who? (2 points)
**Encrypted Message:** `JYWMEIDVRTTYDOZPEDSUGQ`  
**Key:** `POELR`  
**Answer:** [HAVINGFUNCRACKINGCODES]  
**Steps Taken:**
-The prompt mentioned the key was "encoded twice," which hinted at using multiple ciphers
I assumed ROT13 might be one of them and applied it to the given key: POELR
ROT13 output was CBYRE, which didn‚Äôt make sense at first, but sounded like a scrambled version of cyber
Guessed the final key was cyber
Used CyberChef ‚Üí Vigen√®re Decode with cyber as the key

### Challenge 10: Kasiski Who? (2 points)
**Encrypted Message:** `AAAAA AAAAB BAAAA AAAAA AAABA AAAAA AAABB AAAAA AAAAB BAAAA AAAAA`    
**Answer:** [ABRACADABRA]  
**Steps Taken:**
Researched the cipher description and found it matched the Bacon Cipher (developed by Francis Bacon).
Pasted the message into CyberChef and used the Bacon Cipher Decode tool.
At first, it didn‚Äôt show anything useful, so I changed the translation setting from 0/1 to A/B.
The correct solution ABRACADABRA was revealed.

### Challenge 11: Arch EXIF! (2 points)    
**Answer:** [flag{h1ding_in_plane_s1ght}]  
**Steps Taken:**
Uploaded Arch.jpg to CyberChef
Used the "Extract EXIF" tool under Forensics
Found a suspicious Base64 string in the Make tag
Decoded it with "From Base64" to reveal the hidden flag
